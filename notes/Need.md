- Websites were simple where webpages were requested by the user and sent to browser by server.
- later JS was introduced so that JS will change the part of DOM rather than reqesting the entire html and css over and over again.
- however it became more and more complex to mange wepages as size grew and diffrent browsers rendered websites in diffrent ways.
- hence **Jquery*c* was introducted which gave a simple API to interact with DOM.
- Again with growthv of complexities google introduced AngularJS -- One of major feature was MVC architecture.
- But it was again not capeable of mananging large application hence **Facebook introduced ReactJS**
